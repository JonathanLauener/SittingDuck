# SittingDuck ðŸ¦†
A tool that waits for a Domain Admin to log in and then executes commands on behalf of said Admin

# MonitorLogins
How it Works:
* The program creates a hidden window to receive session change messages.
* `WTSRegisterSessionNotification()` makes the window receive `WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE` messages.
* When a new user logs in, it receives `WTS_SESSION_LOGON`, it calls CheckPermissions, then (if the permissions are valid) it calls `ImpersonateUser()`.

# CheckPermissions
How it Works:
* The function calls `NetUserGetLocalGroups()` to obtain the local group memberships of the specified user from the local machine.
*  The function checks if the user is a member of the group named "DAdmin", using `wcsstr` to perform a case-sensitive substring search on the group names returned. I use the `NetUserGetLocalGroups()` because it is simpler to debug because my machine is not joined to a domain. I will change this once I get the chance to test this in an AD environment. For this to work you will need to make a new user and add them to the "DAdmin" group.

# ImpersonateUser
How it Works:
* The function first retrieves the process ID of the target user (targetUsername) by calling `GetExplorerPidByUser`, then attempts to open the target process to gain access to its authentication token using `OpenProcessToken`
* It duplicates the access token obtained from the target process using `DuplicateTokenEx()` to create a new token with impersonation rights. The function then uses `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser()` to impersonate the target user's security context.
* The function runs a command `(whoami > c:\\ProgramData\\whoami.txt)` in a new process as the impersonated user, using `CreateProcessAsUser()` with the duplicated token to create and execute the process (cmd.exe) in the target user's context.
* I use `notepad.exe` as the process of the target user because I have tried other processes and those have not worked (I am guessing because explorer.exe might be a PPL process). The program also waits 30 seconds before executing the command, giving the target time to open notepad (for debugging).
